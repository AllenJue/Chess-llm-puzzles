    "aggressive_explanation": "My move, g7, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it not only maintains the material advantage gained by capturing the pawn on f5, but it also creates a strong passed pawn on the g-file. This pawn can potentially become a powerful attacking force and put pressure on the opponent's king. Additionally, it also restricts the opponent's king from moving to the g-file, limiting their options. \n\nThe other GMs' suggestion, Kxf5, may seem like a good move as it maintains the material advantage and brings the king closer to the center. However, it also leaves the king vulnerable to potential checks or attacks from the opponent's pieces. Furthermore, it does not contribute to the overall position and control of the board as much as g7 does. \n\nIn terms of tactical vs positional factors, my move focuses more on the positional aspect of the game. By creating a strong passed pawn, it improves the overall position and control of the board. On the other hand, Kxf5 may have a tactical advantage in the short term, but it does not contribute to the overall position and control of the game. \n\nIn conclusion, my move, g7, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it maintains the material advantage, creates a strong passed pawn, and contributes to the overall control of the board. It is a more strategic and long-term move compared to the tactical Kxf5.",
    "positional_explanation": "My move, g7, is a strong positional move that aims to improve the pawn's position on the board. By advancing the pawn to g7, it creates a potential passed pawn and puts pressure on the opponent's king. This move also opens up the diagonal for the bishop, allowing for potential attacking opportunities.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of g7 may have some tactical benefits, such as creating a potential pin on the h-file or opening up the h8 square for the rook. However, it also leaves the pawn vulnerable and potentially exposed to attacks from the opponent's pieces.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of g7 is a safe move that maintains the current position on the board. However, it does not offer any significant advantages or improvements to the game.\n\nOverall, I believe my move, g7, is superior as it offers both positional and potential tactical advantages. It improves the pawn's position and opens up attacking opportunities, while also maintaining a solid defense.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\ng7",
    "neutral_explanation": "My move, g7, is a strong positional move that advances my pawn and creates a potential passed pawn on the g-file. This pawn can become a powerful attacking asset in the endgame. It also opens up the diagonal for my bishop to potentially control and attack the opponent's position.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of g7 also has similar positional benefits, but it may be too aggressive and risky. By advancing the pawn, my king will be exposed and vulnerable to potential attacks from the opponent's pieces. This could potentially backfire and put me in a disadvantageous position.\n\nThe positional GM's suggestion of g7 is a more strategic move. By advancing the pawn, it creates space for my pieces to maneuver and potentially control the center of the board. However, this move does not have the same immediate impact as my suggestion. It also does not create a passed pawn, which can be a valuable asset in the endgame.\n\nOverall, I believe my move, g7, is the best choice as it combines both positional and potential attacking elements. It creates a strong position for my pawn and opens up potential attacking opportunities, while also maintaining a solid position for my king. It is a balanced and strong move that can give me an advantage in the game.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\ng7"
