    "aggressive_explanation": "My move, Rc5+, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it maintains the material advantage and puts pressure on the opponent's king. It also creates a potential threat of checkmate by attacking the opponent's king with both the rook and the bishop. This move also takes into account the opponent's potential counterattacks and defends against them by controlling the c5 square. \n\nOn the other hand, the positional GM's suggestion of Rc5+ is also a strong move, as it maintains material advantage and puts pressure on the opponent's king. However, it does not create any new threats or attacks, and the opponent may still have a chance to defend or counterattack. \n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of Rc5+ is also a valid move, as it repeats the same position and maintains the material advantage. However, it does not offer any new ideas or threats, and the game could potentially end in a draw if the opponent is able to defend well. \n\nIn conclusion, my move, Rc5+, is the best choice as it combines both tactical and positional elements, putting pressure on the opponent's king and defending against potential counterattacks. It also maintains the material advantage and keeps the game in my favor.",
    "positional_explanation": "My move, Rc5+, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it is a strong positional move that also has tactical potential. By moving my rook to c5, I am controlling an open file and potentially attacking the opponent's king. This move also helps to protect my pawn on c4, which is a key pawn in the center of the board.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of Rc5+ is also a good move, as it puts immediate pressure on the opponent's king. However, it may not be the best move in this particular position as it leaves my rook vulnerable to being captured by the opponent's queen.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of Rc5+ is a safe move, but it does not fully utilize the potential of my rook on the open c-file. It also does not address the potential threat to my pawn on c4.\n\nOverall, my move of Rc5+ is the best choice as it combines both positional and tactical elements, making it a strong and effective move in this position.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nRc5+",
    "neutral_explanation": "My move, Rc5+, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it is both aggressive and positional. By moving my rook to c5, I am attacking the opponent's knight on c6 and potentially creating a pin on their queen. This move also controls the open c-file and puts pressure on the opponent's position.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of Rc5+ is solely focused on attacking the opponent's knight, but it does not consider the potential positional advantages of this move. The positional GM's suggestion of Rc5+ is also focused on controlling the c-file, but it does not take into account the aggressive potential of this move.\n\nIn chess, it is important to have a balance between aggression and positional play. My move, Rc5+, achieves this balance by both attacking the opponent's pieces and controlling an open file. This makes it a superior move compared to the other GMs' suggestions.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nMy final recommendation is: Rc5+"
