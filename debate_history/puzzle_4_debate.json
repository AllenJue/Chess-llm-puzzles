    "aggressive_explanation": "My move, h1=Q, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it promotes the pawn to a queen, giving me a powerful attacking piece. This move also creates a potential checkmate threat on the opponent's king, as the queen can now move freely along the h-file.\n\nOn the other hand, the other GMs' suggestions of h1=Q do not have the same tactical advantage. While it does promote the pawn to a queen, it does not have the same immediate impact on the opponent's position. It also does not create a potential checkmate threat.\n\nOverall, my move of h1=Q is a strong and decisive move that puts me in a winning position. It combines both tactical and positional elements, making it the superior choice.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nh1=Q",
    "positional_explanation": "My move, h1=Q, is a tactical move that aims to promote the pawn to a queen and create a strong attacking position. It also opens up the possibility for a future checkmate on the opponent's king.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of h1=Q may be too aggressive and could potentially lead to a stalemate if the opponent is able to block the promotion.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of h1=Q is a safe move, but it does not have as much potential for creating a strong attacking position as my move does.\n\nIn terms of positional factors, my move may not have an immediate positional advantage, but it sets up the potential for a strong attacking position and creates a threat that the opponent must respond to.\n\nOverall, I believe my move of h1=Q is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it balances both tactical and positional factors, while also setting up potential for a checkmate. It also does not have any immediate weaknesses or drawbacks.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nh1=Q",
    "neutral_explanation": "My move, h1=Q, is a neutral move that promotes the pawn to a queen. This move can potentially create a powerful attacking piece and put pressure on the opponent's king.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of h1=Q is also a strong move, as it promotes the pawn to a queen and can potentially lead to a checkmate. However, this move may also leave the queen vulnerable to attacks and may not have an immediate impact on the game.\n\nThe positional GM's suggestion of h1=Q is a strategic move, as it promotes the pawn to a queen and controls the center. However, this move may also limit the mobility of the queen and may not have an immediate impact on the game.\n\nIn my opinion, my neutral move of h1=Q is the best choice as it promotes the pawn to a powerful piece without committing to a specific strategy. It also puts pressure on the opponent's king and can potentially lead to a checkmate. Both the aggressive and positional moves have their merits, but they also have potential drawbacks that could be exploited by the opponent. Therefore, my move is superior as it does not give the opponent any immediate advantages.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nh1=Q"
