    "aggressive_explanation": "My move, Rg7+, is a strong positional move that maintains pressure on the black king and controls the open g-file. It also creates a potential passed pawn on the g-file, which could be used to create a strong attack. Additionally, it avoids any potential counterplay from the black pieces.\n\nOn the other hand, the other GMs' suggestions, Rg7+ and Rg7, are also strong positional moves that maintain pressure on the black king and control the open g-file. However, they do not create a passed pawn and could potentially allow for counterplay from the black pieces.\n\nIn terms of superiority, it ultimately depends on the specific position and the style of the player. In this case, Rg7+ is the most efficient and effective move, as it maintains a strong attacking position while also avoiding any potential counterplay. It shows a good understanding of both tactical and positional elements of the game.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nRg7+",
    "positional_explanation": "My move, Rg7+, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it is a strong positional move that also has tactical implications. By sacrificing the rook on g7, I am opening up the g-file and putting pressure on the opponent's king. This move also creates a potential back rank weakness for the opponent, as their rook on h8 is now pinned by my queen on h3. This allows for a potential checkmate with Qh3# in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, the aggressive GM's suggestion of Rg7+ is purely tactical and does not take into account the overall position of the game. While it may lead to a quick checkmate, it does not consider the long-term consequences of sacrificing the rook for a potential mate. It also does not address any potential counterplay from the opponent.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of Rg7+ is a solid move, but it does not fully capitalize on the positional advantages gained by sacrificing the rook. It also does not address the potential back rank weakness for the opponent.\n\nIn conclusion, my move, Rg7+, is the best choice as it combines both positional and tactical elements, while also considering potential future consequences and counterplay from the opponent. It is a strong move that puts pressure on the opponent and sets up potential checkmate opportunities in the future.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nRg7+",
    "neutral_explanation": "My move, Rg7+, is superior because it is a tactical move that immediately threatens the opponent's king and puts them in a difficult position. By sacrificing the rook, I am able to open up the g-file and bring my queen into the attack. This creates a strong attacking position and puts pressure on the opponent to defend their king.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion, Rg7+, is also a strong move, but it relies on a forced checkmate that may not be immediately achievable. It also leaves the rook vulnerable to being captured if the opponent is able to defend effectively. In contrast, my move maintains material equality and keeps the pressure on the opponent.\n\nThe positional GM's suggestion, Rg7+, is a more strategic move that aims to weaken the opponent's pawn structure and create long-term advantages. By capturing the g7 pawn, I am able to create a doubled pawn for the opponent and potentially open up the g-file for future attacks. However, this move does not have the immediate threat and pressure that my move has.\n\nIn conclusion, my move, Rg7+, is the best choice as it combines both tactical and positional elements. It immediately puts the opponent on the defensive and creates long-term advantages for my position. While the other GMs' suggestions have their merits, my move is the most well-rounded and effective choice.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nRg7+"
