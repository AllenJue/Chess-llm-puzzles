    "aggressive_explanation": "My move, Rxg3+, is a strong tactical move that aims to open up the h-file for my rook and create threats against my opponent's king. By sacrificing my rook, I am also gaining a pawn and potentially creating a passed pawn on the h-file.\n\nThe positional GM's suggestion of Rxg3+ may also be a strong move, as it opens up the h-file and creates threats against the opponent's king. However, it does not gain a pawn and may leave my king vulnerable to attacks.\n\nOverall, I believe my move, Rxg3+, is a better choice as it combines both tactical and positional elements. It also gains material and creates a strong passed pawn, while still maintaining a strong attack on the opponent's king.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nRxg3+",
    "positional_explanation": "My move, Rxg3+, is a strong tactical move that aims to capture the opponent's pawn on g3 and potentially open up the g-file for my rook to attack. It also creates a double attack on the opponent's king and queen, putting them in a difficult position.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of Rxg3+ is also a strong tactical move, but it does not have the same impact as my move. By capturing the pawn on g3, I am also opening up the g-file for my rook to attack, while the aggressive GM's move does not have a clear follow-up.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of Rxg3+ is a safe move, but it does not have the same attacking potential as my move. It also does not create any immediate threats or put pressure on the opponent's position.\n\nIn terms of positional factors, my move also has the advantage of controlling the center and potentially opening up lines for my pieces to attack. It also does not create any weaknesses in my position.\n\nOverall, my move is superior because it combines both tactical and positional elements, creating immediate threats while also improving my overall position. It also puts the opponent in a difficult position and gives me the advantage in the game.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nRxg3+",
    "neutral_explanation": "My move, Rxg3+, is a strong tactical move that can lead to a forced checkmate. By sacrificing the rook, I am able to open up the g-file and create a direct attack on the opponent's king. This move also removes a defender of the king, making it easier to penetrate the opponent's position.\n\nIn terms of positional factors, Rxg3+ also helps to control the center of the board by forcing the opponent's king to move and potentially creating weaknesses in their pawn structure. It also allows for the possibility of a discovered check or a double attack on the opponent's pieces.\n\nWhile both the aggressive and positional GMs suggest Rxg3+, my reasoning for choosing this move is that it offers a strong tactical advantage while also maintaining control of the center. This move also puts immediate pressure on the opponent and forces them to make defensive moves, potentially giving me the initiative in the game.\n\nIn comparison, the aggressive GM's suggestion of Rxg3+ may be too one-dimensional and could potentially leave weaknesses in my own position if the attack is not successful. The positional GM's suggestion of Rxg3+ is also a strong move, but it does not offer the same level of tactical advantage as my move.\n\nOverall, I believe my move, Rxg3+, is the superior choice as it offers a strong tactical advantage while also maintaining control of the center, giving me the best chances for a successful attack and potential checkmate.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nRxg3+"
