Glicko-2 Rating System Implementation

This module implements the Glicko-2 rating system for chess puzzle evaluation.
The implementation is based on the work by Heungsub Lee.

Original implementation: https://github.com/heungsub/glicko2

This is a Python port of the Glicko-2 rating system as described in:
