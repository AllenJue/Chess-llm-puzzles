    "aggressive_explanation": "My move, h5, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it creates a strong pawn structure for black on the kingside. This pawn can potentially become a strong attacking force and put pressure on white's king. Additionally, by pushing the h-pawn, black gains control over the g4 square, preventing white's knight from occupying it. This move also opens up the possibility for black's rook to enter the game via the h-file. Overall, h5 is a strong positional move that maintains black's advantage and creates potential for further attacking opportunities.",
    "positional_explanation": "My move, f5, is a strong positional move that aims to control the center of the board. By pushing the pawn to f5, I am creating a strong pawn chain in the center and potentially opening up the f-file for my rook. This move also limits my opponent's options for developing their pieces.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of h5 may seem tempting, as it immediately creates a threat on the opponent's king. However, this move also weakens my own king's position, as it opens up the h-file for potential attacks. It also does not contribute to my overall positional strategy.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of h5 is a safe move, but it does not take advantage of the potential benefits of controlling the center and creating a strong pawn chain.\n\nOverall, my move of f5 is superior because it not only strengthens my own position, but also limits my opponent's options. It sets me up for potential attacking opportunities while also maintaining a strong positional advantage.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nf5",
    "neutral_explanation": "My move, h5, is a strong positional move that aims to control the g6 square and potentially create a weakness in my opponent's pawn structure. It also opens up the possibility for my bishop to move to h6 and put pressure on my opponent's king.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of h5 is a more aggressive move that aims to create immediate threats on my opponent's king. However, it may also weaken my own king's position and leave it vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe positional GM's suggestion of f5 is also a strong move that aims to control the center of the board and potentially create a strong pawn structure. However, it may not have the same immediate impact as my move and may allow my opponent to develop their pieces more easily.\n\nOverall, I believe my move is superior as it combines both positional and tactical elements. It sets me up for a strong position in the long run while also creating immediate threats on my opponent's king. It also forces my opponent to react and potentially make mistakes, giving me the upper hand in the game.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nh5"
