    "aggressive_explanation": "I believe that Qh2 is the best move in this position. This move not only maintains the material advantage gained by capturing the rook on e7, but it also puts pressure on the black king and opens up the possibility of a queen and rook battery on the seventh rank. This could potentially lead to a checkmate or a forced exchange of queens, further solidifying the white's advantage. Additionally, Qh2 is a more aggressive move compared to Qxe7+, which simply repeats the position. In a game where every move counts, it is important to constantly put pressure on the opponent and maintain the initiative. Therefore, I believe that Qh2 is the best move in this position.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nQh2",
    "positional_explanation": "My move, Qh2, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it not only protects my king by moving it to a safer square, but it also puts pressure on the opponent's king by attacking the pawn on g3. This creates a strong attacking position for me and limits the opponent's options for defending their king.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion, Qh2, is a solid move as it also puts pressure on the opponent's king. However, it does not take into account the safety of my own king and leaves it vulnerable to potential attacks.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion, Qh2, is a safe move as it protects my king and maintains a strong position. However, it does not take into account the potential for a discovered check and the added pressure it can create.\n\nIn conclusion, my move, Qh2, is the best choice as it not only protects my king, but also creates a strong attacking position and puts pressure on the opponent's king. It takes into account both tactical and positional factors, making it a superior move compared to the other GMs' suggestions.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nQh2",
    "neutral_explanation": "My move, Qh2, is the most aggressive and tactical option. By placing my queen on h2, I am able to put pressure on my opponent's king and potentially launch a deadly attack. This move also opens up the diagonal for my bishop to attack the king. Additionally, it forces my opponent to make a defensive move, giving me the initiative in the game.\n\nThe positional GM's suggestion, Qh2, is also a strong move. It maintains material equality and puts pressure on the opponent's king. However, it does not have the same immediate impact as my move, as it does not directly attack any of the opponent's pieces.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion, Qh2, is a more defensive move. While it does put pressure on the opponent's king, it does not have the same attacking potential as my move. It also leaves my queen vulnerable on the open file.\n\nOverall, my move, Qh2, is the best choice as it combines both tactical and positional elements. It puts pressure on the opponent's king and forces them to make defensive moves. It also sets up potential attacks and maintains material equality.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nQh2"
