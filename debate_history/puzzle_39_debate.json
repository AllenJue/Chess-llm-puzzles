    "aggressive_explanation": "My move, Rxh7#, is superior to the other GMs' suggestions because it is a decisive move that leads to checkmate. By sacrificing my rook, I am able to open up the h-file and deliver a checkmate on the next move. This is a strong tactical move that takes advantage of the weakened position of my opponent's king. \n\nOn the other hand, the other GMs' suggestions of Rxh7 or Rxh7+ are also strong moves, but they do not lead to an immediate checkmate. While they may create threats and put pressure on my opponent, they do not have the same level of decisiveness as Rxh7#. \n\nFurthermore, Rxh7# is a more aggressive move compared to Rxh7 or Rxh7+. It shows my determination to win the game and puts my opponent under immense pressure. This can potentially lead to mistakes and further advantages for me. \n\nIn conclusion, Rxh7# is the superior move as it is a decisive move that leads to checkmate, takes advantage of the weakened position of my opponent's king, and maintains the aggressive momentum in the game. While the other GMs' suggestions are also strong moves, they do not have the same level of decisiveness and potential for advantages as Rxh7#.",
    "positional_explanation": "My move, Rxh7#, is a strong tactical move that also has positional implications. By sacrificing my rook on h7, I am opening up the h-file for my queen to attack my opponent's king. This creates a strong mating threat and puts my opponent in a difficult position.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of Rxh7# is also a good move, but it focuses solely on the tactical aspect of the position. While it may lead to a quick checkmate, it does not have the same long-term strategic benefits as my move. Additionally, it may leave my rook vulnerable to attack if my opponent is able to defend against the immediate threat.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of Rxh7# is a safe move, but it lacks the same level of aggression and initiative as my move. By playing Rxh7#, I am taking control of the game and forcing my opponent to react to my moves.\n\nOverall, I believe my move, Rxh7#, is superior because it combines both tactical and positional elements, giving me a strong advantage in the game. It also puts pressure on my opponent and forces them to make difficult decisions, while the other GMs' suggestions may not have the same impact.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nRxh7#",
    "neutral_explanation": "My move, Rxh7#, is a strong tactical move that sacrifices a rook for a checkmate. It takes advantage of the opponent's weakened king position and uses the rook's long-range attacking abilities. This move also eliminates any potential counterplay from the opponent.\n\nThe positional GM's suggestion of Rxh7# also has similar benefits, but it may not be as aggressive. It still sacrifices a rook for a checkmate, but it may not have the same immediate threat as my move.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of Rxh7# is also a good move, but it may not have the same attacking potential as my move. It may be a more defensive move, as it eliminates any potential counterplay from the opponent.\n\nOverall, I believe my move, Rxh7#, is the best choice as it combines both tactical and positional elements. It takes advantage of the opponent's weakened king position while also eliminating any potential counterplay. It also sets up a strong attack in the future.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nRxh7#"
