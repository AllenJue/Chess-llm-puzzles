    "aggressive_explanation": "My move, Kg5, is superior because it continues to put pressure on my opponent's king and maintains control over the center. By moving my king to g5, I am also preparing to potentially bring my rook to the h-file for a potential attack on my opponent's king. Additionally, by keeping my king active, I am preventing my opponent from creating any counterplay.\n\nThe positional GM's suggestion of Kg5 is also a strong move, as it maintains control over the center and prepares for potential attacks. However, it does not have the same attacking potential as my move.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of Kg5 is also a valid move, but it does not have the same impact as my move. By moving the king, I am also creating a potential escape square for my opponent's king, which could potentially give them some breathing room.\n\nIn summary, my move Kg5 is superior because it combines both positional and tactical factors. It maintains control over the center, prepares for potential attacks, and prevents my opponent from creating counterplay. It is a move that not only improves my position, but also puts pressure on my opponent.",
    "positional_explanation": "My move, Kg5, is a strong positional move that aims to improve the placement of my king. By moving my king to g5, I am bringing it closer to the center of the board and potentially preparing for a king-side attack. This move also puts pressure on my opponent's position, as their king may now be exposed to potential checks or threats.\n\nIn contrast, the aggressive GM's suggestion of Kg5 may lead to a more open and dynamic game, but it also leaves my king vulnerable to potential attacks. This could backfire if my opponent is able to exploit the exposed king.\n\nThe neutral GM's suggestion of Kg5 is a safe and solid move, but it does not have the same impact on the position as my move. It maintains the balance of the game, but does not give me any significant advantage.\n\nOverall, I believe my move, Kg5, is the best choice as it combines both positional and tactical elements. It improves the placement of my king and puts pressure on my opponent, while also maintaining a solid position for my pieces.\n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nKg5",
    "neutral_explanation": "My move, Kg5, is a strong positional move that also has tactical benefits. By moving my king to g5, I am centralizing my king and potentially preparing for an attack on the enemy's king. This move also puts pressure on the f6 pawn, potentially weakening my opponent's pawn structure.\n\nThe aggressive GM's suggestion of Kg5 is a risky move that may leave my king vulnerable. By moving my king to g5, I am exposing it to potential checks and attacks from my opponent's pieces. This move also does not have a clear tactical purpose, as it does not directly attack any of my opponent's pieces.\n\nThe positional GM's suggestion of Kg5 is a solid move, but it lacks the tactical punch of my move. By moving my king to g5, I am not only centralizing it, but also potentially preparing for an attack on the enemy's king. This move also puts pressure on the f6 pawn, potentially weakening my opponent's pawn structure.\n\nIn conclusion, my move, Kg5, is the superior choice as it combines both positional and tactical elements. It centralizes my king, potentially prepares for an attack, and puts pressure on my opponent's pawn structure. It is a well-rounded move that strengthens my position and puts pressure on my opponent. \n\nBased on the debate, provide your FINAL recommendation.\nGive ONLY the move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., \"Qe1#\" or \"Nf3\").\nDo not explain further - just the move.\n\nKg5"
